This is my first article which will be talking about printed circuit boards. I am going to start writing these types of posts in hope of diversifying my blogs since
so far I only have Arduino projects. As a heads up these articles will follow a simple format of introducing a technology topic, discussing it, and encouraging
you to research it more for yourself.

## Printed Circuit Boards Defined
According to google a printed circuit board or PCB is...

>an electronic circuit consisting of thin strips of a conducting material such as copper, which have been etched from a layer fixed to a flat insulating sheet called a printed circuit board, and to which integrated circuits and other components are attached.

A more simpler definition would be that it is a board that connects electronic components. In order to appreciate the PCBs importance in the modern day, let us go back into history and discuss its lifespan.

## History of the PCB
#### Part 1: Humble Beginnings

The story of the PCB starts with the life of Paul Eisler, an Austrian Jew that was born in Vienna in 1907. At the age of 23, he had graduated with an engineering degree from the Vienna University of Technology. For the next 5 years or so Eisler wrote for newspapers, started a journal about radios, and began to learn about printing technology. It was also during this time that he began to think about how the printing process could be used to lay down electronic circuits on a insulated base. Ultimately, the idea of printing wires on a board and mounting elements over it started here. In 1936, he decided to leave Austria for London in order to escape Nazi persecution. In London Eisler created the first printed circuit for a music typewriter for the musical printing company Henderson and Spalding. In 1943 he filed for a patent and from here he gained a small amount of fame as after the Second World War the technology spread and the United States mandated airborne instrument circuitry was to be printed. The patents themselves did not net Eisler that much profit and in the later years of his life he bounced from field to field creating multiple inventions. Ultimately, Paul Eisler's invention of the printed circuit board brought him little financial return but instead benefitted the entire world's electronics industry as it would be widely used. He passed away in London on the 26th of October, 1992, aged 85.
