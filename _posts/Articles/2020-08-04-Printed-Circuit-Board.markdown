This article will be talking about printed circuit boards. I am going to start writing these types of posts in hope of diversifying my blogs since I only have Arduino projects so far. As a heads up these articles will follow a simple format of introducing a technology topic, discussing it, and encouraging you to research it more for yourself.

## Printed Circuit Boards Defined
According to google a printed circuit board or PCB is...

>an electronic circuit consisting of thin strips of a conducting material such as copper, which have been etched from a layer fixed to a flat insulating sheet called a printed circuit board, and to which integrated circuits and other components are attached.

A more simpler definition would be that it is a board that connects electronic components. The board uses "conductive pathways", "tracks", or "signal traces" that are etched from copper sheets and fixed into it. In order to appreciate the PCBs importance in the modern day, let us go back into history and discuss its lifespan.

## History of the PCB
#### Part 1: Creation

The story of the PCB starts with the life of Paul Eisler, an Austrian Jew that was born in Vienna in 1907. At the age of 23, he had graduated with an engineering degree from the Vienna University of Technology. For the next 5 years or so Eisler wrote for newspapers, started a journal about radios, and began to learn about printing technology. It was also during this time that he began to think about how the printing process could be used to lay down electronic circuits on an insulated base. Ultimately, the idea of printing wires on a board and mounting elements over it started here. In 1936, he decided to leave Austria for London in order to escape Nazi persecution. In London, Eisler created the first printed circuit for a music typewriter for the musical printing company Henderson and Spalding. In 1943 he filed for a patent and from here he gained a small amount of fame as after the Second World War the technology spread and the United States mandated airborne instrument circuitry was to be printed. The patents themselves did not net Eisler that much profit and in the later years of his life he bounced from field to field creating multiple inventions. Ultimately, Paul Eisler's invention of the printed circuit board brought him little money but instead benefitted the entire world's electronics industry as it would later be widely used. He passed away in London on the 26th of October, 1992, aged 85.

#### Part 2: Modern Day

Today PCBs can be found everywhere we look, from the PC you are currently using to see this message, to household appliances. Modern electronics has been founded on this very device, they are present in medical equipment, manufacturing machinery, and the very machines that make them! From a simple electronic children's toy to space ships, the world's technology is held upon PCBs. It almost makes you wonder how a world without this device would even function. But from this thought also recognize that all it took was the idea of Paul Eisler, a single person, to thrust humanity into a new technological era. Despite PCBs existing for 80 years, the worldwide market is continuing to grow with Lucintelâ€™s Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Market Report 2019 predicting the global PCB market to reach USD 89.7 billion by 2024.

## Composition of a PCB

Think of a PCB as a cake that has alternating layers of different materials that are laminated together to create a single object.

#### Substrate

The base material of a PCB is often fiberglass which is given the name "FR4. Characteristics for this material include its rigidness and thickness, while also remaining flexible. Cheaper versions of this are made with other materials like epoxy or phenolics and lack the durability of FR4.

#### Copper

After the FR4, the next layer is a thin copper foil that is lamented onto the board with heat and adhesive. Copper is a used component due to its obvious conductive ability, with it having the best conductivity amongst metals.

#### Soldermask

This layer on top of the copper foil is what gives the PCB its recognizable green color. Soldermask is a protective layer of thin polymer that is applied on the top and bottom of the PCB. Its function is to protect the copper from oxidation and prevent accidental contact with other metals or conductive areas.

#### Silkscreen

The final layer of a PCB is the white silkscreen that is applied on top of the soldermask. Silkscreen adds the letters, numbers, and symbols, to the device that allows the user to better understand the board. It is often used as labels to indicate the function of a pin and can come in almost any color.

## Different Types of PCBs

PCBs come in different versions with the most basic type being the single layered original board that has been previously talked about in this article. Research and development of this device have created double and multi layered versions. Essentially, these boards have multiple copper layers laminated to two or more substrate layers, making it possible to add more electrically dense components. Thus, you can create even more powerful devices using these modified boards and if it breaks, you can simply buy a new one instead of attempting to repair it due to its affordability.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I hope you learned a thing or two regarding PCBs and are able to recognize the importance they have in our everyday lives. Another amazing thing about this device is that you can create one yourself! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3jFsNffzxQ) is a two part video series made by Circuit Basics on YouTube that teaches you how to configure your own board. Researching and writing about this topic was a blast and I hope to see you again when I talk about another topic in the vast field of technology!
