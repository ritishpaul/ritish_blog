In today's article I want to go over the history of computers and their progression over the decades. Since we use these machines so much in our daily lives, it is important to have at least a broad understanding of their origin and progression. As a result this article is written in hopes that you will not only learn a bit about computers, but also be interested in researching the topic yourself.

## Definition of Computer

The term "computer" is a pretty wide one and can encompass much more than a digital screen that people nowadays are familiar with. Prior to the mid 20th century, usages of the word refer to a human that carried out calculations or computations. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the use of the term "computer" in the modern context to mean **"programmable digital electronic computer"** dates back to 1945. This modern usage of the word is what I will be discussing in the article. Thus think of this is as a brief history of digital computers. You can classify digital computers in three categories: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation with each one belonging to a different time period and providing an innovative computer or improvement.

## 1st Generation

The first generation of digital computers introduced machines that could only perform one specific task and had no operating systems. These computers were characterized by weighing a lot and required a great deal of power to function.

#### Atanasoff-Berry Computer
The age of digital computers started in 1937 when the first electronic digital computer was conceived by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. It was titled the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) and was designed to only solve systems of linear equations. Its CPU was more 300 vacuum tubes, had a memory of 3000 bits, weighed 700 pounds and used punch cards as input. Despite this, however, the ABC had several innovations including electronic computation, binary arithmetic, parallel processing, regenerative capacitor memory, and a separation of memory and computing functions. In fact some of these ideas are still part of every modern computer, these are:

1. Using binary digits to represent all numbers and data.
2. Performing all calculations with electronics rather wheels or mechanical switches.
3. Organization of a system in which computation and memory are apart.

#### Colossus
The Colossus is regarded as the world's first programmable, electronic, digital computer that was developed by the British from 1943-1945. Its purpose was to decipher radio teleprinter messages that were encrypted by the German Lorenz cipher machine during the Second World War. There were two types of Colossi, the prototype Mark 1 Colossus and the improved Mark 2 that was used until the end of the war. For the CPU, it used custom circuits that had thermionic valves and thyratrons with a total of 2400 in the MK 2. The computer did not use any memory, used paper tape for input, and required 8.5 kW of power. Sadly, Colossus's construction remained a secret for 30+ years after the war thus not being mentioned in the history of computers in that time frame.

#### ENIAC
ENIAC or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the world's first general purpose digital computer that was able to solve a plethora of numerical problems. It was completed in 1945 and used to calculate artillery ballistics for the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. At the end of the operation in 1956, ENIAC comprised of 20,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays and around 5,000,000 hand soldered joints. It weighed more than 27 tons, occupied 1800 square feet, and needed 150kW of electricity to function. ENIAC's calculation speed was impressive as it was one thousand times faster than that of common computers of the time. For example, it calculated a trajectory in 30 seconds which took a human 20 hours to accomplish. As a result, it was an insane machine that thrilled scientists and industrialists all over the world.

## 2nd Generation
