For my first arduino project, I will be creating a simple but effective binary counter. This counter will be able to show numbers up to 15 in binary. This project will 
reinforce the concept of circuit flow and refamiliarize yourself with the fundamentals of an arduino with a breadboard.

## Required Items

- 9x Jumper Wires
- 4x LEDs
- 4x 220 Ohm Resistors
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x Breadboard

## Understanding Binary 
Before we get into this project, I would like to dedicate a bit of text to define binary and its importance in technology. 

#### What is Binary?


Binary is a base 2 number system that was invented by [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz), a prominent German polymath during the 17th century. It is made up of two numbers: 0 and 1. These numbers can
be put together in combination to create larger numbers that can store more information. For example 1110 is equal to 14.

#### How does Binary Work?
The numbers 0 and 1 represent OFF or ON, as a result, these numbers are shown physically inside the computing device which permits calculation. Binary numbers work in conjunction with
binary code. Binary code can represent text, computer processor insructions, or any other data. The code assigns a pattern of binary digits, known as bits to each character. In this case,
binary code is used to encode data, allowing humans to represent characters in human languages or other symbols. 

Here is a table that shows binary numbers up to 15 with their decimal value. 

| Exponent	  | Value		| Binary      |
|    :----:   |    :----:   |    :----:   |
| 2^0	      | 1       	| 0000		  |
| 2^1         | 2           | 0001        |
| 2^2	  	  | 4		    | 0010        |
| 2^3		  | 8			| 0011        |
