Greetings! I am back with another tutorial about a special tool that you can use in your Arduino projects. The DHT11 Temperature Sensor is a cool and interesting device that allows you to measure the temperature and humidity of the space it is in. This tutorial will help you understand more Arduino code, a and talk about its libraries you can use. In addition to this I will be hooking it up to a LCD display, check out my [previous tutorial](https://ritishpaul.github.io/ritish_blog/project/Arduino-LCD-Display.html) on it if you wish to do the same.

## Required Items
- 3x Jumper Wires (19x w/LCD Screen)
- 1x DHT11 Temperature Sensor
- 1x LCD Screen (Optional)
- 1x 10k ohm potentiometer (Optional)
- 1x 220 ohm resistor (Optional)
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x Breadboard

## Understanding the DHT11 Sensor

#### Concept

The concept of the sensor is that it is a basic, low cost digital temperature and humidity detector.
