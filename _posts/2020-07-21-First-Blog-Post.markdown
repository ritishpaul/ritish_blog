![The Begininng of Something](/ritish_blog/images/sovietpainting.jpg)

As the first post for this blog, I will dedicate it to how I created this site. It was difficult to say the least as
I was a novice to web building but with perserverance and experience with computer programming I have a finished product.
It looks clean and does its purpose to which I am proud of. In this post, I will discuss the three parts of this site's birth: ideation, implementation, and reflection.

## Ideation

Ideation is the "formulation of ideas or concepts", in this the idea is this website. Thus the question I will be answering is why did I make this site?
The short answer is documentation. The long answer is as follows: to be able to record and write about topics regarding technology, in which I or anyone viewing this site can refer to.
In addition to this, I wished to also showcase any projects that I have created in the past and discuss them to the reader.

#### Motivation

Motivation was something that was the main driving force for this site's creation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic I have been quarantined for months. 
I had been spending the time playing video games which was not at all productive. When the summer break hit, I was getting bored of my insane lifestyle
and needed a change. This change came as an idea of doing a technology-related project. For some reason, the first thought that popped into my head was to create a website.
The more I formulated this idea in my mind, the more excited I was to accomplish it, thus birthing the motivation. It offered me the opporunity to create something that showcased my character
and skills as a novice programmer.
