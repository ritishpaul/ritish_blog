![The Begininng of Something](/ritish_blog/images/sovietpainting.jpg)

As the first post for this blog, I will dedicate it to how I created this site. It was difficult to say the least as
I was a novice to web building but with perserverance and experience with computer programming I have a finished product.
It looks clean and does its purpose to which I am proud of. In this post, I will discuss the three parts of this site's birth: ideation, implementation, and reflection.

## Ideation

Ideation is the "formulation of ideas or concepts", the idea is this website. Thus the question I will be answering is why did I make this site?
The short answer is documentation. The long answer is as follows: to be able to record and write about topics regarding technology, in which I or anyone viewing this site can refer to.
In addition to this, I wished to also showcase any projects that I have created in the past and discuss them to the reader.

#### Motivation

Motivation was something that was the main driving force for this site's creation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic I have been quarantined for months. 
I had been spending the time playing video games which was not at all productive. When the summer break hit, I was getting bored of my insane lifestyle
and needed a change. This change came as an idea of doing a technology-related project. For some reason, the first thought that popped into my head was to create a website.
The more I formulated this idea in my mind, the more excited I was to accomplish it, thus birthing the motivation. It offered me the opporunity to create something that showcased my character
and skills as a programmer.

## Implementation

So how did I create this website? I first set up my GitHub account and learnt about GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a easy way for users to host websites that are connect to the account's repositories. 
This was perfect for me as I simply wanted to publish a website without having to buy a domain for it. With this out of the way, I needed to figure out a way to write the website.

#### Jekyll

After searching through the web once more, I came across Jekyll, a static site generator for blogs. According to its GitHub page, "Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates,
and creates a complete, static website ready to be served by a web server." This was perfect for the type of site that I was thinking of. In order to learn about the basics of Jekyll, I watched these [tutroials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB). 

#### GitHub and Git

I used Git to create a file of the website onto my computer and work on it locally. Using Git was optional since it is mainly utilized for projects involving more than one programmer.
Since this is an independent site I could of simply coded it via its GitHub page, but I chose not to. Why? Because learning Git is a skill that would help me for group projects.
Git is popular amongst programmers as it is used to track changes in projects and because of this you never know when you may need to know a control system like that.

#### Markdown 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is creating rich text using a plain text editor. It is the language that I am currently using to communicate these words to you.
It is fairly easy to understand and with a syntax cheat sheet you can know the majority of it in no time. Perfect for a blog!

## Reflection

After the site was finished and I could begin writing my posts, I began thinking of my ideation. Speficially, I thought of how I was able to put forth my idea into something tangable like this site.
I learned a great deal by creating this website. For example Ruby, Jekyll, GitHub, Git, and Markdown. But most importantly I began appreciating the field engineering more. 
The aspect of creating something and the process of planning is something that exhilirates me more than anything. As a result, I hope you expect more blog posts that are about tech-related
projects that I have created. This will be the crux of this site.
