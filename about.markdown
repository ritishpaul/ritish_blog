Hello! My name is Ritishpaul Sangha and I am currently a senior in high school. My passion for all things tech related is what made me create this blog so that I can document my journey in this field. Specifically, the COVID 19 pandemic gave me an opportunity to try web design and Github while learning more about electronic engineering. In addition to this, I hope the people browsing my website may learn at least one piece of information from my posts so that they are less ignorant. 

Apart from this, I enjoy other activiities and hobbies such as reading, playing the occasional video game, and particpating in sports. In terms of career, I hope to work in the field of computers and one day be able to contribute to it. Whether that be large or miniscule, it does not matter so as long as I give back to the study that has given me the most joy. Personally, I grew up pusing technology with my first experience using my Windows XP PC that was hooked up to a CRT monitor. I remember being in awe at all of the different applications and functions this one machine had and wondered how something like this could be even perceived.   

The current hardware I use to update this website is:
- Lenovo Thinkpad T430
- Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse  

The current software I use to update this website is:
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 
- Github
- Github Pages
- Git
